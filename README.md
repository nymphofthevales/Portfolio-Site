# Portfolio_Site
The structure for my personal portfolio website. 
Uses dynamic javascript to inject HTML into the parent page site.html when different content is desired by the user, instead of navigating across different HTML pages. Also has a nice sliding menu with CSS and JS which I'm proud of. A current version of the site is hosted at www.nymphofthevales.com.
