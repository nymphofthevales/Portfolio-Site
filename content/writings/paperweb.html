<h4>Thesis</h4>
<p class="indent">The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood depicts the treatment of individuals in a totalitarian system under which individual rights are severely restricted in the name of common good, and through this asks us to consider the benefits and disadvantages of collectivism.</p>
<h4>Part 1: Story and Setting</h4>
<ol class="ndent">
<li class="subhead">Gilead</li>
<p class="indent">The book is set in the fictional state of Gilead, which arose in an alternate history of the United States sometime in the late 20th century (the epilogue mentions that “this was the age…of the infamous AIDS epidemic” (304) which would place it in the 1980s). Gilead’s government is totalitarian; beyond the complete political control a strict authoritarian government would exercise, they also reach for control of all aspects of their citizens’ lives, including mobility, religion, and sexuality. Similar to Nazi Germany they act in a reactionary way, reaching for an idealized past, in this case based in Christian ideals. Gilead is currently (and it seems, has always been, much like the state of Oceania in Orwell’s <i>1984</i>) at war to solidify its territory and destroy “heretical” religious groups. This constant state of war is, though not clearly shown within the book, probably also a method to justify extreme actions in the name of national safety like increased surveillance and crackdowns on public gatherings (which are in actuality used to remove political dissidents) due to a state of emergency, similar to the United States during the Cold War.</p>
<li class="subhead">Goals of the Gileadean Regime</li>
<p>As stated in the epilogue, which comes in the form of a historian lecturing on the ‘Gileadean Period’:</p>
<p class="quote">Gileadean society was under a great deal of pressure, demographic and otherwise, and was subject to factors from which we ourselves are happily more free. (302)</p>
<p>Every totalitarian regime comes into power for a reason; some issue, social or economic or otherwise, that they claim to be able to solve by wielding absolute power and instating their ideals. The Nazi Party was tasked with returning Germany to greatness and prosperity in the wake of WWI. The Communist Party aimed to destroy the divide between social classes and liberate the workers of the nation. For Gilead, this issue is infertility, and the risk that in time, there may not be any people left to govern if birth rates are not increased. The actual aforementioned AIDS epidemic was a factor in this, as well as pollution, but the causes are less important than the fact that it was a problem which needed solving.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the Gileadean regime’s goals is to establish a cultural myth or shared vision to bring the people together and encourage obedience to their ideals, and play a part in solving the infertility issue (this cultural myth is largely forced upon the population through the use of indoctrination, propaganda, and terror, which will be explored in Part 2). Women, especially fertile women, are vital to their cause. In order to give them control of these women, a large part of their shared vision is focussed on the creation of a “women’s culture,” giving promises that under their system women will be protected, and experience feelings of fulfillment, and camaraderie with other women. This of course comes at the expense of some of the civil rights which would be guaranteed under liberalism (this will be discussed further in Part 3):</p>
<p class="quote">As the architects of Gilead knew, to institute an effective totalitarian system or indeed any system at all, you must offer some benefits and freedoms, at least to a privileged few, in return for those you remove. (308)
</p>
<p>The main part of these benefits and freedoms come in the form of power, specifically power over other women. By using women to rule at the lower level, especially in the indoctrination centres (these enforcers are called “Aunts”), it supports the cultural myth that this society has been established for the benefit of women, and is matriarchal, while in reality it is fiercely patriarchal and aims for full control over women.
</p>
<li class="subhead">Structure of Society</li>
<p class="indent">Gilead is an oligarchy, in which a small group of individuals hold ruling power; in this case they are called the “Commanders” and are all men. Women are split into roughly three notable categories: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Wives, who are married and largely infertile,</li>
<li>Handmaids, who are unmarried, or whose marriages are invalid under Gileadean rule (any marriage after divorce, that is second or third marriages, were invalidated near the beginning of Gileadean rule in order to create this class of women), and are fertile. They are considered government property and mostly doled out to the elites desiring children:
<p class="quote">Fertility in Gilead is at a premium. Fertile women, women who can reproduce, are prize objects for those in power. (Atwood 319, Author Interview)</p>
Handmaids are also assigned to lower class men as part of the government plan to increase birth rates, but it seems this is on a lottery system (22).</li>
<li>Unwomen, who are unmarried, infertile, and therefore useless to the government except as labour; they are exported to the Colonies. The risk of being reclassified as Unwomen is held over the heads of the Handmaids and others to encourage their obedience.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some small amount of women were also retained as Marthas, who serve as household labour for the upper class, but in terms of the broad strokes of Gileadean society they are not as important to discuss. The main character of the story is Offred, a Handmaiden who belongs to one of the  Commanders. It’s important to note that, like all Handmaids, she has been given a new name to denote her status as a piece of property; Offred is “Of Fred,” based on her Commander’s name. This ties into the idea of the cultural myth, this naming convention being a callback to chattel slavery in the American South; establishing that, in this society too, people can be property.
</p>
<li class="subhead">Economy in Gilead</li>
<p class="indent">There is very little revealed about the external affairs of the country, so nothing on the larger economic scale, imports and exports and such, can be gleaned, but from Offred’s experience it can be seen that the economy is centrally planned, and money has been abolished. The food needed for the family is provided by the government, and redeemed in the market by the use of  tokens:</p>
<p class="quote">I take the tokens from Rita’s outstretched hand. They have pictures on them, of the things they can be exchanged for: twelve eggs, a piece of cheese, a brown thing that’s supposed to be a steak. (11)</p>
<p>The abolition of paper money was one of the earliest acts of the Gileadean regime, done mostly to disenfranchise women. Once all transactions were done on credit cards it was a relatively simple act to cancel the accounts of all women and transfer their funds to their husband or male next of kin (178-179). After that was done, money could eventually be abolished altogether, and the centrally planned system seen above could be instated. By having such a system, it gives the government greater control over what goods citizens can and cannot get their hands on, and removes free choice. There is no competition and no free market, only one, government run, store for each commodity; Lilies of the Field for dresses, Milk and Honey for produce, All Flesh for meat, and so on (25-27). Availability and quality of goods may be affected by this; it is mentioned that some things (such as oranges) are often unavailable due to the war (25), however it is unclear if this would be solved by a free market system, so it cannot be considered a commentary on the effectiveness of centrally-planned economies.
</p>

<h4>Part 2: Gaining and Keeping Power</h4>
<ol class="ndent">
<p class="indent">In the state of Gilead’s rise to power many similarities can be drawn to the methods used by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia and in its methods for keeping power it uses many of the techniques common to authoritarian governments in general.
</p>
<li class="subhead">Use of Military Power</li>
<p class="indent">At first, violent revolutionary tactics and seizure of the government like the Bolsheviks led by Lenin did in the October Revolution of 1917 were used. Offred recalls “a catastrophe, when they shot the president and machine-gunned the Congress and the army declared a state of emergency” (174). After this point it’s not clear who exactly took control of what was once the American government, but they would become Gilead; they are stated to be a religious group seeking total control and the creation of a theocratic state. They establish themselves as a military dictatorship, like Mussolini in Italy and Franco in Spain, and gradually use this military power to enforce their new laws. One of the first examples of this is the removal of women from the workforce (it is within their religious ideals that women belong in the home):
</p>
<p class="quote">I’m sorry, he said, but it’s the law. I really am sorry. I have to let you go…It isn’t me, he said. You don’t understand. They’re outside, he said, in my office. If you don’t go now they’ll come in themselves. They gave me ten minutes…I could see out into the corridor and there were two men standing there, in uniforms, with machine guns. (176)
</p>
<p>This quote comes from Offred’s employer at the time, and shows the subtle use of military power to impose what would have been a very controversial law at the time. It is not violent or bloody, but by having the men with guns there it is enough of a threat to quell dissent. 
</p>
<p class="indent">The Gileadean paramilitary are used in more violent ways as well. Another instrument in the rise of Gilead is suppression of protestors similar to what the Nazi’s paramilitary organization, the SA, did. Offred recalls this in Chapter 28: 
</p>
<p class="quote">There were marches, of course, a lot of women and some men…it was known that the police, or the army, or whoever they were, would open fire almost as soon as any of the marches even started. (180)
</p>
<li class="subhead">Secret Police</li>
<p class="indent">The Eyes are the Gileadean Secret police—working much like the Nazi SS and Russian KGB to root out political dissidents after the regime has established itself:
</p>
<p class="quote">Right in front of us the van pulls up. Two Eyes, in gray suits, leap from the opening double doors at the back. They grab a man who is walking along, a man with a briefcase, an ordinary-looking man, slam him back against the black side of the van…They pick him up and heave him into the back of the van like a sack of mail…the van moves on. What I feel is relief. It wasn’t me. (168-169)
</p>
<p>Offred’s thought at the end of the quote here is significant because it is exactly the thought the regime wants to put into people’s minds through this use of terror; this action of picking off a man in broad daylight is done quickly, but does not try to be hidden. By letting it be seen what happens to those who oppose the regime, it deters others from trying and encourages obedience to the state.
</p>
<li class="subhead">Use of Terror</li>
<p class="indent">One of the most commonly seen uses of terror in Gilead is the use of public execution and display of the resultant bodies on an infrastructure known as The Wall. Offred walks past The Wall every time she goes to market, such that looking over the fresh corpses of the day is almost a mundanity.
</p>
<p class="quote">Beside the main gateway there are six more bodies hanging, by the necks, their hands tied in front of them. The men wear white coats, like those worn by doctors or scientists. Each has a placard hung around his neck to show why he has been executed: a drawing of a human fetus. They were doctors, then, in the time before, when such things were legal. (32)
</p>
<p>In this case the enemies of the state hung on The Wall were abortion doctors; in Gilead, where fertility is so vital, the killing of a fetus is a heinous crime. The public display of their corpses cements the shared vision that their actions were wrong, and acts as a warning to any who would deviate from that shared vision.
</p>
<p class="indent">Similar to the Nazi belief in Aryan superiority, the Gileadean regime sought to remove religious groups which did not fall within their ideal. People not willing to submit to this were violently removed: 
</p>
<p class="quote">That’s been on the TV too: raids at night, secret hoards of Jewish things dragged out from under beds, torahs, talliths, Magen Davids. The owners of them, sullen faced, unrepentant, pushed by the Eyes against the walls of their bedrooms, while the sorrowful voice of the announcer tells us voice-over about their perfidy and ungratefulness. (201)
</p>
<li class="subhead">Propaganda and Indoctrination</li>
<p class="indent">The Gileadean regime largely avoids the expense of the production of propaganda through omission; for Handmaids like Offred, reading and writing is illegal (52). This is as effective, or perhaps more effective, at reducing the spread of ideals which would not benefit the regime. The only media allowed to be consumed is either specific passages from the Bible, read aloud by the Commander on certain nights, or the state-controlled television, which mostly shows victories and heroes of the war effort, or successes in the hunting-down of escaped rebels. This supports a shared vision of the regime as invincible and powerful, and rebellion as futile.
</p>
<p class="indent">Gilead has a thorough system for indoctrination, in the form of “Re-Education Centres”. It is there where the Handmaids have the Gileadean ideology and obedience to the state hammered into them; they are forced to believe in it by methods of abuse, mental and physical, as well as frequent humiliation in front of their peers (note that Aunts are not literal family figures but the teachers and enforcers in these Re-Education centres, named as such in keeping with the cultural myth of matriarchy as mentioned in Part 1):
</p>
<p class="quote">But whose fault was it? Aunt Helena says, holding up one plump finger. Her fault, her fault, her fault, we chant in unison. Who led them on? Aunt Helena beams, pleased with us. She did. She did. She did. Why did God allow such a terrible thing to happen? Teach her a lesson. Teach her a lesson. Teach her a lesson. (72)
</p>
<p>It can clearly be seen in this example how the Handmaids are made to re-contextualize their past experiences through the lens of the new Gileadean ideology. This style of humiliation also pits them against one another, making it so that they feel as though they cannot trust their peers, nor even themselves—their only constant ally is Gilead. “Gilead is within you.” (23)
</p>
<li class="subhead">Controlled Participation</li>
<p class="indent">Building on the distrust of their peers created during the re-education process, the Handmaids are used to spy on each other, look for any signs that their partner is anything other than a perfect Gileadean citizen. They are paired up in this fashion whenever they leave the house, which is primarily to go to market:
</p>
<p class="quote"> We aren’t allowed to go there except in twos. This is supposed to be for our protection, though the notion is absurd: we are well protected already. The truth is that she is my spy, as I am hers. If either of us slips through the net because of something that happens on one of our daily walks, the other will be accountable. (19)</p>
<p class="indent">Another example of controlled participation is the Salvaging, a sort of cultural ritual in which criminals are presented before a crowd and executed after having their crimes read to the crowd. The crowd act as a jury to condemn them, each person stating whether they agree with the verdict, but of course this is merely a mock trial, because each and every person in the crowd knows that if they dissent, it will be them with the rope around their neck next. The “Particicution” (a portmanteau from the phrase “participatory execution”) is a later part of this event, in which the Handmaids get a chance to direct their rage and discontent to a man convicted of rape or a similar crime (which may be true, but this is more often used as a way to remove dissidents, of course) by beating him to death in a crowd.
</p>

<h4>Part 3: Individualism vs Collectivism</h4>
<ol class="ndent">
<li class="subhead">Protection of Health</li>
<p class="quote">“Careless. I was careless, in those rooms. I could lift the telephone and food would appear on a tray, food I had chosen. Food that was bad for me, no doubt, and drink too.” (51)
</p>
<p class="indent">This passage comes from when Offred is recalling the experience of being in hotel rooms, something which she has not experienced since before Gilead. In Gilead, staying in such a room is unfathomable; she doesn’t have the choice to travel, needs nowhere else to stay. Hence, this quote exemplifies the removal of free choice which is enforced under a totalitarian system. But it’s important to note that this is not necessarily a negative thing; Offred is nostalgic for this choice, but also recognizes that it probably brought harm to her, in this case to her physical health. After all, she chose food that was “bad for [her], no doubt” (51). The obvious conclusion for a government which wants to protect the health of its citizens, (in this case especially the Handmaids, because their physical health is instrumental to the goal of raising birth rates), is to mandate strictly what can be consumed in the way of food, drugs, etc. And indeed, tobacco in the form of cigarettes, caffeine, alcohol, and the like, are ostensibly illegal in Gilead (in the case of most citizens they still seem to be widely available through a black market—this rule is mostly for the Handmaids):
</p>
<p class="quote">The cigarettes must have come from the black market, I thought, and this gave me hope. Even now that there’s no real money anymore, there's still a black market…I looked at the cigarette with longing. For me, like liquor and coffee, they are forbidden. (14)
</p>
<p>Another example of this is this is health care under the Gileadean regime:
</p>
<p class="quote">I’m taken to the doctor’s office once a month, for tests: urine, hormones, cancer smear, blood test; the same as before, except that now it’s obligatory. (59)
</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this is done for utilitarian reasons, not humanitarian ones; it is done because the health of the individual in this case is useful to the society as a whole, not because health and life are seen as inalienable rights as they may be under liberalism. Once the Handmaids cease to be fertile and healthy, their usefulness has run out—they are labelled as ‘Unwomen’ and sent to the Colonies for use as cheap labour (61).
</p>
<li class="subhead">Safety and Free Choice</li>
<p class="indent">Through this aspect of the story Atwood considers the balance between individual freedoms (which would be emphasized under individualism or liberalism) and public safety (which is emphasized under Gilead’s collectivism). In Gilead, government control of women is seen as a means for protection. And this is more than propaganda to encourage obedience—it works:
</p>
<p class="quote">Now we walk along the street, in red pairs, and no man shouts obscenities at us, speaks to us, touches us. No one whistles. There is more than one kind of freedom, said Aunt Lydia. Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don’t underrate it. (24)
</p>
<p>The “days of anarchy” here refers to the pre-Gilead era, the United States of America in which individualism is one of the core tenets. Calling this time “anarchy” implies that it was lawless and unsafe. Therefore, in Gilead safety comes at the expense of some civil rights which would be otherwise protected under individualist ideologies. Instead of having freedom of mobility, freedom to choose what to eat, freedom to love men to whom the government has not appointed you, you are given safety. Stability. If you cannot make any choices at all, you can never make a bad choice. And when the utility of the individual to their society is more important than their own fulfillment, this is a logical course. Atwood asks us to consider what’s more important: society’s needs or individuals’ freedom?
