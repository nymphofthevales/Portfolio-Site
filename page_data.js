        <p>Hello!<br><br>Welcome to my site! I'm a queer trans artist, programmer, and writer from Alberta, Canada. I love finding new ways to share stories and create experiences for others; through writing, games, animation, illustration... Combining these mediums and tools in new ways to create unique things brings me so much joy.
        <br>
        <br>
        This digital portfolio contains all the work that I'm proud of as well as information about the various projects I've worked on. I hope you find something of interest to you!

        <h3>Process Info</h3>
        <p>For all my digital art and animation, I use Clip Studio Paint EX and a Wacom Intuos 7 tablet.<br><br>For writing and organizing larger projects, such as my <i>Keeper of the Labyrinth</i> game, I use Scrivener extensively, which has been an invaluable tool for me.<br><br>For my geometric tiled drawings and animations, I tend to plan the figures first on paper with compass and straightedge.</p>
