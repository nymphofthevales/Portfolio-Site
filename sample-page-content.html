    <p>I first read Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i> in early 2020, and I can hardly describe the effect it had on me. Ever since, I find I keep coming back to it, just flipping to a random page and reading aloud to myself, and each time I do I discover some new insight that I hadn't seen in it upon first reading. It's a marvelous book: The way the author plays with memory and perception and the very concept of stories, the way each of the cities seems to speak to some deeper truth about humanity, the beautiful language use and structure that places so much meaning into every physical aspect of the cities described, turning even the most seemingly mundane things into profound metaphor, ah! I took my time with it, end even then I couldn't get enough. My only lament is that I couldn't read it in the original Italian!</p>
    <p>After reading it, I felt so inspired that I wished to write something in the same style, to capture a spark of what makes his depictions of cities so special to me. It is a feeble attempt, but it is mineâ€“I believe it speaks for itself here.</p>
